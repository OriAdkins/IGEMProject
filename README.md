# IGEM Project for TMAU Patients

## Purpose

The purpose of this app is to assist TMAU Patients with tracking various hormones by utilizing a (in development) scanner.

The app will track these various compounds and then notify the user when they should be taking various supplements/medicince, ect.

**Note:** This app is ONLY for demo purposes, it is non-functional as the scanner is still in development, the purpose of this is to showcase what an app utilizing the scanner could look like, and how it could function. Features will be listed below in functional and planned sections.

## Feature List

### Functional
* Login screen
* View for home page, which shows if a device is connected
* Screen that shows hormone levels, and if they are 'good' or 'bad'

### Planned if full release
* Full bluetooth connectivity
* Logic to understand scanner instream
* Full database which would allow for historical data tracking
